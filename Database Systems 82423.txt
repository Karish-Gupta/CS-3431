Database Systems 8/24/23:

- Spread sheets have difficulty in maintaining relationships between files 
- Spread sheets don't have java funtionality


- Client sends queries across the network to the DB server
- So the queries mmust be efficent 


Super Keys - Subset of attributes that uniquely identify each tuple (a set of candidate keys)

Candidate Keys - Minimal super key (single attribute)

Primary Keys - Choose any of the candidate keys
	     - Represented by “underline” under the selected attributes
	     - (Programmer selects the key that will uniquely identify tuples)

Set vs. Bag - If a relation has a primary key, then the relation is a set and not a bag
	    - (There can be no duplicates in sets, but bags can have duplicates)
